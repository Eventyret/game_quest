## The Project
This game is an extra curricular collaborative experiment in using the HTML canvas, CSS and vanilla JavaScript by 3 students who are on a Software Development course. Each of us wanted to challenge ourselves to develop our coding skills, understand more about the JavaScript language, learn how to 
collaboratively use git and develop software in a team environment.

The game is designed to replicate an 80's style guided adventure game, with its chunky graphics, items to collect, puzzles to solve and other game characters to interact with, avoid or kill!

In a bid to create a faithful replication of an 80's game, quirks which were commonly found in 80's games have been put in, such as:
 - nnnn
 - nnnn
 - nnnn

# The Quest!
Over to Bim our creative genius to explain ;-)



## How can I play?
The Arrow keys to move the mighty Thor around the map.

A (Action) - This enables the player to pick up items they're next too, take items from Non-Playable Characters (NPC's) when offered and interact with puzzle pieces.
S (Speech) - This enables the player to see the dialogue between Thor and NPC's.
D (Death!) - This enables Thor to unleash his anger on those who displease him! Either through his lightening bolts or sword.


## Beta Release
The Beta release will be our proof of concept, where we will create a small version of the game which encompasses all the key functionality.

Once this is complete the next step will be a code review, after which the first version of the game will be released.
